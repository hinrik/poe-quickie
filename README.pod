=head1 NAME

POE::Quickie - A lazy way to wrap blocking programs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use POE::Quickie;

 sub handler {
     my $heap = $_[HEAP];

     my $heap->{quickie} = POE::Quickie->new();
     $heap->{quickie}->run(
         Program     => ['foo', 'bar'],
         StdoutEvent => 'stdout',
         Context     => 'remember this',
     );
 }

 sub stdout {
     my ($output, $context) = @_[ARG0, ARG1];
     print "got output: '$output' in the context of '$context'\n";
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you need nonblocking access to an external program, or want to execute
some blocking code in a separate process, but you don't want to write a
wrapper module or some L<POE::Wheel::Run|POE::Wheel::Run> boilerplate code,
then POE::Quickie can help. You just specify what you're interested in
(stdout, stderr, and/or exit code), and POE::Quickie will handle the rest in
a sensible way.

It has some convenience features, such as killing processes after a timeout,
and storing process-specific context information which will be delivered with
every event.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

Constructs a POE::Quickie object. You'll want to hold on to it.

Takes 3 optional parameters: B<'debug'>, B<'default'>, and B<'trace'>. These
will be passed to the object's L<POE::Session|POE::Session> constructor. See
its documentation for details.

=head2 C<run>

This method starts a new program. It returns the process id of the newly
executed program. It takes the following arguments:

B<'Program'> (required), will be passed to POE::Wheel::Run's constructor.

B<'AltFork'> (optional), if true, a new instance of the active Perl
interpreter (C<$^X>) will be launched with B<'Program'> (which must be a
string) as the code (I<-e>) argument, and the current C<@INC> passed as
include (I<-I>) arguments. Default is false.

B<'ProgramArgs'> (optional), same as the epynomous parameter to
POE::Wheel::Run.

B<'StdoutEvent'> (optional), the event for delivering lines from the
program's STDOUT. If you don't supply this, they will be printed to the main
program's STDOUT. To explicitly ignore them, set this to C<undef>.

B<'StderrEvent'> (optional), the event for delivering lines from the
program's STDERR. If you don't supply this, they will be printed to the main
program's STDERR. To explicitly ignore them, set this to C<undef>.

B<'ExitEvent'> (optional, the event to be called when the program has exited.
If you don't supply this, a warning will be printed if the exit status is
nonzero. To explicitly ignore it, set this to C<undef>.

B<'Timeout'> (optional), a timeout in seconds after which the program will
be forcibly killed if it is still running. There is no timeout by default.

B<'Context'> (optional), a variable which will be sent back to you with every
event. If you pass a reference, that same reference will be delivered back
to you later (not a copy), so you can update it as you see fit.

B<'WheelArgs'> (optional), a hash reference of options which will be passed
verbatim to the underlying POE::Wheel::Run object's constructor. Possibly
useful if you want to change the input/output filters and such.

=head2 C<shutdown>

This shuts down the POE::Quickie instance. Any running jobs will be killed.

=head2 C<programs>

Returns a hash reference of all the currently running programs. The key
is the process id, and the value is the context variable, if any.

=head1 OUTPUT

The following events might get sent to your session. The names correspond
to the options to L<C<run>|/run>.

=head2 StdoutEvent

=over 4

=item C<ARG0>: the chunk of STDOUT generated by the program

=item C<ARG1>: the process id of the child process

=item C<ARG2>: the context variable, if any

=back

=head2 StderrEvent

=over 4

=item C<ARG0>: the chunk of STDERR generated by the program

=item C<ARG1>: the process id of the child process

=item C<ARG2>: the context variable, if any

=back

=head2 ExitEvent

=over 4

=item C<ARG0>: the exit code produced by the program

=item C<ARG1>: the process id of the child process

=item C<ARG2>: the context variable, if any

=back
