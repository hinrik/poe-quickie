Revision history for POE-Quickie

{{$NEXT}}

0.18  Thu Dec 15 21:57:10 GMT 2011
    - Depend on POE 1.350. In previous versions, sig_child would not be
      delivered in some cases, causing a test failure.

0.17  Wed May 25 05:44:37 GMT 2011
    - Fix another error in t/09_resultevent.t which was causing failures

0.16  Sat May 21 01:16:52 GMT 2011
    - Add missing dependency on Test::Deep
    - Fix test failure in 09_resultevent.t

0.15  Thu May 19 16:14:53 GMT 2011
    - Change the order of arguments to ResultEvent to fit my sense of their
      order of importance
    - Events/functions which return the complete stdout/stderr will now
      return arrays instead of strings so it works with non-linebased output.
    - Eliminate the 'WheelArgs' parameter. Instead, any extra arguments will
      be passed to POE::Wheel::Run.
    - Shut down the child's stdin if we don't have input to pass to it

0.14  Fri Apr 29 03:17:16 GMT 2011
    - Add a warning to the Pod about using the convenience functions in
      synchronous event handlers.
    - Add a ResultEvent to combine the best features of quickie() and run()
    - Add a quickie_run() function as a shorthand for POE::Quickie->run()

0.13  Wed Apr 27 07:49:39 GMT 2011
    - Try to avoid a timing-related failure in the 04_timeout.t test
    - Deliver StdoutEvent/StderrEvent/ExitEvent synchronously

0.12  Sat Sep 25 07:57:23 GMT 2010
    - Made the docs more readable and added more links
    - Made the wording of one warning a bit clearer
    - Rename programs() method to processes()
    - Depend on POE 1.291 for correct exit value handling in POE::Wheel::Run
    - If we catch an exception, prefix the warning with 'POE::Quickie'

0.11  Thu Sep 2 21:11:57 GMT 2010
    - Change the API a bit to make it more of a singleton

0.10  Tue Aug 17 22:55:26 GMT 2010
    - Make all warnings fatal

0.09  Mon Aug 2 09:42:54 GMT 2010
    - We were shutting down stdin too soon. Fixed and added a test for it.

0.08  Mon Aug 2 09:19:37 GMT 2010
    - Add an 'Input' parameter to run() for writing to the program's stdin

0.07  Sat Jul 3 04:20:02 GMT 2010
    - Enable CloseOnCall on non-Win32 only instead of on Win32 only.
    - Make sure the testing dependencies go into build_requires

0.06  Mon Jun 28 19:29:56 GMT 2010
    - Improve docs in a few places
    - Allow specifying a signal to killall()

0.05  Sat Jun 26 02:02:56 GMT 2010
    - Made 06_lazy.t a little less strict

0.04  Thu Jun 24 11:09:18 GMT 2010
    - Recreate our POE session in case it had run out of work and died

0.03  Thu Jun 24 01:33:27 GMT 2010
    - Fix a bug in the SYNOPSIS and improved the docs elsewhere as well

0.02  Thu Jun 24 01:21:17 GMT 2010
    - Renamed CopyINC to AltFork (like POE::Component::Generic and other
      modules call this feature) and made it croak if used on Win32
    - Make sure we have reaped the child process before we emit ExitEvent
    - Added an Capture::Tiny-like interface which "blocks" (while running
      other POE code) while executing programs
    - Replaced the shutdown() method with killall()

0.01  Wed Jun 23 13:30:10 GMT 2010
